Hi there, I'm Maggie Thompson, currently a PhD Candidate at UC Santa Cruz in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics

I study terrestrial planets and their atmospheres using a combination of laboratory experiments and modeling techniques.
I conduct outgassing experiments with meteorites to better understand rocky planets' early atmospheres.
I am also interested in astrobiology and thinking about which biosignatures may be detectable in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres with upcoming observatories.

I am currently working on a combination of laboratory experiments and modeling tools.
