Hi there, I'm Maggie Thompson, PhD planetary scientist currently working at ETH-ZÃ¼rich in the Experimental Planetology group.

I study terrestrial planets and their atmospheres using a combination of laboratory experiments and modeling techniques.
During my PhD, I conducted outgassing experiments with meteorites to better understand rocky planets' early atmospheres. I am currently studying how volatiles partition between hot, rocky exoplanet interiors and their atmospheres using both modeling tools and solubility experiments.
I'm also interested in astrobiology and thinking about which biosignatures may be detectable in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres with upcoming observatories like JWST.
